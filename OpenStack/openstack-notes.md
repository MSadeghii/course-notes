## Development, contribution, issue tracking and community

1. Links
   1. [Openstack Source](https://opendev.org/openstack/)
   2. [Mirror of Openstack in GitHub](https://github.com/openstack)
2. Workflow
   1. Uses concept of **changes** rather than pull requests
   2. **[Gerrit](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/)** is used for reviews
   3. Steps to perform a change
      1. Clone the repository
      2. Create a new branch
      3. Make changes and commit
      4. Then propose to Gerrit using   **git-review**
      5. After this Zuul is used for continuous integration and runs tests
      6. Human review
      7. If issues found, ammend for commit is called
      8. Once changes approved by Zuul and human reviewers, Zuul performs gate tests and merges it
